### Form Validation Schema
```typescript
const clientSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Client name is required"),
  companyName: z.string().min(1, "Company name is required"),
  contactEmail: z.string().email("Valid email is required"),
  contactPhone: z.string().optional(),
  notes: z.string().optional(),
})
```

### File Structure
```
src/
├── app/dashboard/clients/
│   ├── page.tsx              # Client list page
│   └── new/page.tsx          # Add client form page
├── components/forms/
